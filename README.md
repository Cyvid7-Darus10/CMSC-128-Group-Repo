 # **Coffee ni Juan Online Shop**

#### Problem or Opportunity
>Kape Giting is a startup that started at the beginning of the Covid pandemic. They are a small coffee shop and retail company that works directly with local farmers. Their mission is to make home brewing coffee that is nutritious, sustainable, and inexpensive for everyone by sourcing it from Filipino coffee farmers. Hence, they sell their coffee beans and coffee grounds for every Juan. 

>Currently, the store does not have a digital resource planning system in place to manage day-to-day business operations such as accounting, inventory management, and data analytics. Moreover, they also do not have their own web portal to manage customer orders and product sales. All the work, management, and burdens that a business faces are all on the shoulder of the owner.

#### Solution
>What we aim to deliver is a website that will assist the business owner in growing their business by providing a safe and user-friendly one-stop online shop, a detailed management system, and data analytics to help them boost their efficiency and productivity thus, improving their business performance.
